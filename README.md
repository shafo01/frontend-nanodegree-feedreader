## Getting Started
To get started, download and unzip this project on the master branch. Open the unzipped folder and then open the index.html file in your web browser. Scroll down to the bottom to see the test results. All of the current tests were passed. To load content from the other feeds click on the hamburger menu on the left to reveal a list of other feeds. Click on any to update the current content.

To edit the test suites, go to jasmine/specs/feedreader.js. There you will see all of the test suites and tests.

## Acknowledgement
This project was an assessment from Udacity. They provided the starter code and I was just required to write the jasmine tests. 

Whilst completing this project the Jasmine documentations(https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite) were very helpful.

A git post from https://gist.github.com/davilious/9503539 showed me how to test for event clicks.
